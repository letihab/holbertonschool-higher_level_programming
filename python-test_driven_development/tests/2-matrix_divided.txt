>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
>>> matrix =[[6, 8, 10],[12, 14, 16]]
>>> div = 2
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, div)
[[3.0, 4.0, 5.0], [6.0, 7.0, 8.0]]

Note that quotients are rounded to a maximum of two decimal places

>>> matrix = [ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

The original matrix is left unchanged.

>>> matrix = [[1.1, -2.2, 3.3], [4.4, 5.5, -6.6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
[[0.37, -0.73, 1.1], [1.47, 1.83, -2.2]]

Integers and float can be combined

::
>>> matrix = [[1, -2.2, 3, 4.4, 5], [-6.6, 7.00, 8, 9.999, 1]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
[[0.33, -0.73, 1.0, 1.47, 1.67], [-2.2, 2.33, 2.67, 3.33, 3.33]]
